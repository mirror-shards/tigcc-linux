This tool is meant mainly for internal use during installation.
It takes the current value of $TIGCC, and puts code into /etc/bashrc (when run
as root) or ~/.bashrc (otherwise) to set $TIGCC to the current value, and to
append it to $PATH. If it finds an existing export for $TIGCC, it replaces it
with its current value. It it finds the existing $TIGCC/bin directory in $PATH,
it removes it.

Usage: envreg
