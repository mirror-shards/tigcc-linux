Some explanations about the directory tree:

Directories present in the source release:
- scripts: contains some automated scripts for development (see installation
           instructions for the ones you might want to use)
- sources: contains source code of various tools: patches to GCC and binutils,
           A68k, ld-tigcc, tigcc frontend and the tools used internally by it
           (patcher, parser), tprbuilder
- tigcclib: the TIGCC library developed by Zeljko Juric, including examples (the
            TPR projects provided with TIGCC for Windows), an ExePack launcher
            (pstarter) and documentation

Directories which need to be created for building:
- build: this temporary directory is created automatically during installation
- download: the location where gcc and binutils must be decompressed (see
            installation instructions)

Directories created in the chosen prefix ($TIGCC):
- bin: binaries
- doc: documentation (howto, install, assembler, linker, ...)
- examples: the TPR projects provided with TIGCC for Windows
- include: TIGCCLIB and A68k headers
- lib: TIGCCLIB static library and ExePack launcher object file
- projects: empty folder intended for storing your projects. Can be removed or
            replaced with a symlink to somewhere in your home directory.
